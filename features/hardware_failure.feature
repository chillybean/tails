  As a Tails user
  I want to be warned about hardware failures

  Scenario Outline: Alerting about disk read failures before reaching the Welcome Screen
    Given a computer
    And Tails will detect disk read failures on the <device>
    When I start the computer
    Then the computer boots Tails
    And I see a disk failure message on the splash screen
    Examples:
      | device |
      | SquashFS |
      | boot device |
      | boot device with a target error |

  Scenario Outline: Alerting about disk read failures in GNOME
    Given a computer
    And I have started Tails without network from a USB drive with a persistent partition enabled and logged in
    When Tails detects disk read failures on the <device>
    Then I see a disk failure message
    Then I can open the hardware failure documentation from the disk failure message
    Examples:
      | device |
      | SquashFS |
      | boot device |
      | boot device with a target error |
